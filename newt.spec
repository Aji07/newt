%description
Newt is a windowing toolkit for text mode built from the slang library. It
allows color text mode applications to easily use stackable windows, push
buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, lists, entry fields, labels, and
displayable text. Scrollbars are supported, and forms may be nested to
provide extra functionality. This pacakge contains the shared library
for programs that have been built with newt as well as a /usr/bin/dialog
replacement called whiptail.
